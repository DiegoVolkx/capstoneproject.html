<h1>My Hobbies</h1>
<hr />
<h2>Reading</h2>
<p>I try to read every day. I love it and it's an excellent way of acquiring knowledge. I'm reading right now "The Way of the Superior Man". I mostly read non-fiction books, but from time to time I can enjoy a good novel.</p>
<h2>Doing Exercise</h2>
<p>Very important habit in my life. You can have all the success you want, but if you don't have a good health, you'll never be able to enjoy it. I mostly focus on hypertrophy and strenth training by using calisthenics. The gym environment is a little too much for me; too much noise and waiting and there's not fresh air. On the other hand, training outdoors, right on the nature, feels amazing</p>
<h2>Learning Languages</h2>
<p>My biggest passion is learning languages. I currently speak fluently Portuguese, Spanish, and English. I'm learning Croatian and I know it at a conversational level. My goal is to know 10 languages fluently someday. I love the feeling of being able to talk a new language, especially if it's a language that's not so spoken.</p>
